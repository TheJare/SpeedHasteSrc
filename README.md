# Speed Haste Game Source Code

(C) Copyright 1995-2000 Javier Arevalo Baeza

This is a bunch of pretty old source code. As such, don't expect to be able
to compile it. In fact, there's a missing element, the VTAL sound library
which my brother Juan Carlos wrote as a separate commercial package. I think
I have removed a couple other pieces, but who knows; I don't like to release
commercial source code in compilable form.

Oh yes, the utilities are not here.

It all used to compile using Watcom C++, possibly 10.5 or 10.6, and Borland's
Turbo Assembler.

As far as I'm concerned, you can do whatever you want with this code, use
it as far as applicable law permits.

I don't have much more to say. I hope you have fun with it!
